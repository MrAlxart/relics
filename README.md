[**Relics**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/relics-mod) is a small mod that adds relics to the game (unexpectedly, right?) with unique and useful mechanics that can help both in battles against hordes of monsters and in peaceful farmer or miner life. All relics from this mod are generated in the dungeon appropriate for them: some are generated only in the desert pyramid, others only in the abandoned mine shaft, and some can be found only in the house of the village farmer or hunter. This mod differs from others in its super-flexible customizability and adaptability for your modpack. Through the main configuration file you can customize absolutely everything: from the chances of generation in loot chests, and ending with the all characteristics of relics.
